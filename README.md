# [Blockchain-Blog](https://blockchains-blog.herokuapp.com/)

![responsive design](media/taxes__1_.png)

When most people hear the word blockchain, which refers to a type of decentralized ledger technology, they immediately connect the term with cryptocurrencies. However, it is important to keep in mind that bitcoin just happened to be one of blockchain’s earliest and most popular applications; most experts believe that the potential for other applications of blockchain technology is vast.

## Deployment 

<br>

This project was created on Github then using Gitpod as a development environment to write and push code to Github, before being deployed to Heroku, with the media and static files stored on Cloudinary.

<br>

### Setting up the [![GitHub](https://badgen.net/badge/icon/github?icon=github&label)](https://github.com)

<br>

  * To put your project up on GitHub, you will need to create a [repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) for it to live in.

    * In the upper-right corner of any page, use the  drop-down menu, and select New repository.

    * Type a short, memorable name for your repository. For example, "hello-world".

    * Optionally, add a description of your repository. For example, "My first repository on GitHub."

    * Choose a repository visibility. For more information, [see](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories#about-repository-visibility)

    * Select Initialize this repository with a README.

    * Click Create repository.

Congratulations! You've successfully created your first repository, and initialized it with a README file.

<br>

### Using ![gitpod](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-ready--to--code-908a85?logo=gitpod)
  
  * Start your first workspace

    * The first time you login to Gitpod with GitHub, you will be prompted to “Authorize Gitpod” to access your GitHub account. This creates a connection between Gitpod and your GitHub account, and installs an OAuth App in your GitHub [settings.](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/authentication/github)

    * Gitpod uses the name and email from your GitHub account ID to create a new Gitpod user account. This is sufficient to start a Gitpod workspace on a public repository.

    * Create a repository in [github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) with the desired name of your App or project.

    * Once your github repository is created, click the [green Gitpod button.](https://github.com/Flow-matic/blockchain-blog/blob/main/media/gitpod%20workspace%20green%20button.png?raw=true) This will automatically start creating your workspace environment.

    * [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) environment is used to write your code for your App then gets pushed to Github.

<br>

  * ![Python](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Python&message=3.6.7&color=blue&logo=python&logoColor=ffffff)
    
    * The packages installed for this project can be found in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Flow-matic/blockchain-blog/blob/main/requirements.txt)

<br> 

  * ![Django](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Django&message=2.2.16&color=092E20&logo=django)

    * Django was used as the python framework in the project.


<br>

### Setting up ![Heroku](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Heroku&message=PaaS&color=430098&logo=heroku)

<br>

Make sure you add a procfile to your root directory!

   * The Procfile is always a simple text file that is named [Procfile](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile) without a file extension. For example, Procfile.txt is not valid. The Procfile must live in your app’s root directory. It does not function if placed anywhere else.

   * Once you have your [account](https://www.heroku.com/) ready, login with your credentials.

   * Click New on the top right corner and select “Create new app”.

   * Give your app a name (This will be included in the public URL for your application) and click Create app.

   * This step will take you to the dashboard of your app. Open Deploy tab and scroll to the “Deployment method” section.

   * Select GitHub as the method.

   * It will show a “Connect to GitHub” option where we can provide our GitHub repository. If you are doing it for the first time, Heroku will ask permission to access your GitHub account.

   * Here, you can search for your GitHub repository and click connect:

   * If it’s able to find and connect to the GitHub repository, the Deployment section will show up where you can select if you want Automatic Deployment (as soon as the changes are pushed to GitHub, Heroku will pick them up and deploy) or Manual Deployment.

   * Click Enable Automatic Deploys (because it’s less overhead for demo apps :) ). You can also select the GitHub branch if you need to, deploy from the main branch.

<br>

## Cloudinary

<br> 

What is the purpose of [Cloudinary?](https://cloudinary.com/)

* Cloudinary is an end-to-end image- and video-management solution for websites and mobile apps, covering everything from image and video uploads, storage, manipulations, optimizations to delivery.

* Cloudinary Media DB is a service that allows you to store media files in the cloud.

* Cloudinary is used by 1 million web and mobile application developers at more than 8,000 companies including Condé Nast, Dropbox, Forbes, Outbrain, Taboola and Answers.com. Inc. Magazine has called Cloudinary the "gold standard" of image management on the web.

* create your account with cloudinary first and follow these steps for storing your [media and static files.](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/how_to_integrate_cloudinary)  

* [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) was used to generate the browser icon, then the image was saved and uploaded to cloudinary.

[These checks ensure that your page is optimized for search engine results ranking.](https://github.com/Flow-matic/blockchain-blog/blob/main/media/seo.png?raw=true)
___

## Testing

Validators
  
  * [html file](https://github.com/Flow-matic/blockchain-blog/blob/main/media/html%20errors.png?raw=true) was checked with [W3C markup validation](https://validator.w3.org/) some errors were flagged due to using Django.
    
    * Issues using '{}' brackets, this syntax is necessary to access files and urls and therefore ignored. further research will be needed. 

<br>

  * [CSS file](https://github.com/Flow-matic/blockchain-blog/blob/main/media/css%20pass.png?raw=true) was checked using [CSS validation service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) all code was passed with [2 errors](https://github.com/Flow-matic/blockchain-blog/blob/main/media/css%20error%20.png?raw=true) coming from the (-webkit-transform) and (moz-transform) because it is a vendor extention.
  [This article explains the reason for the errors](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52490004/what-are-all-of-these-w3c-css-validation-warnings-about)

    * At this point, these look like they'd all be safe to remove from the CSS file, but there's no particular benefit in doing so.

<br>

  * [JS Hint](https://jshint.com/) was used for the small amount of JavaScript used, only [(use 'esversion 6')](https://github.com/Flow-matic/blockchain-blog/blob/main/media/js%20scipt%20error.png?raw=true) was flagged up, this article explained the reason for creating a [.jshintrc file in the directory](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27441803/why-does-jshint-throw-a-warning-if-i-am-using-const)

<br>

  * [PEP8](https://www.google.com/search?q=pep8+checker&rlz=1C5CHFA_enNZ963NZ963&oq=pep&aqs=chrome.0.69i59l2j46i131i433i512j69i57j46i131i433i512j69i65j69i60l2.3007j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) was used for testing python code. 

    * In the terminal by typing ( python3 -m flake8 ) and hit return will bring up all issuse within each python code file, saves you looking through every file one by one.

    * I chose to ignore any warnings on migration files since these are automatically generated files so may ignore style rules for efficiency reasons. Also as developers, usually don't need to touch them so they don't need to be perfectly readable.

    * imported but unused, also line too long E501 were some common issues, but at this stage I didn’t want to start breaking up my code, so can live with this, I understand as a developer these will have to be addressed more professionally.

<br>

  * Various browsers and devices have been also tested throughout.

<br>

## Error pages created for users.

<br>

## 400 Bad Request error
  * The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 400 Bad Request response status code indicates that the server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (for example, malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing). 

## HTTP 403 error
  * HTTP 403 forbidden errors are caused by an access misconfiguration on the client-side, which means you can usually resolve the issue yourself. A common cause of these errors is the file or folder permission settings, which control who can read, write, and execute the file or folder.

## 404 Page not found error
  * This error shows when a user types a URL into the browser which does not exist within the app's domain.page not found or file not found error message is a hypertext transfer protocol standard response code, to indicate that the browser was able to communicate with a given server, but the server could not find what was requested.

## 500 Internal server error
  * The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 500 Internal Server Error server error response code indicates that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.

This error response is a generic "catch-all" response. Usually, this indicates the server cannot find a better 5xx error code to response. Sometimes, server administrators log error responses like the 500 status code with more details about the request to prevent the error from happening again in the future.
