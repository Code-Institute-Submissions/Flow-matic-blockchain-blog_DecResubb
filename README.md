# [Blockchain-Blog](https://blockchains-blog.herokuapp.com/)

![responsive design](media/taxes__1_.png)

When most people hear the word blockchain, which refers to a type of decentralized ledger technology, they immediately connect the term with cryptocurrencies. However, it is important to keep in mind that bitcoin just happened to be one of blockchain‚Äôs earliest and most popular applications; most experts believe that the potential for other applications of blockchain technology is vast.

[The government has today announced moves that will see stablecoins recognised as a valid form of payment as part of wider plans to make Britain a global hub for cryptoasset technology and investment.](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-sets-out-plan-to-make-uk-a-global-cryptoasset-technology-hub)

## UX
This project is part of my [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) Full Stack Software Development studies. The idea was to create a blog page for users to register, comment and like various contents about different blockchain technology information. 

Main goals for users
* To make the website interactive for user wanting to learn all about blockchain technology.
    * Various external links are added for each blog posts. ‚úÖ

<br>

* Let users see the latest cryptocurrency prices from the newest coins. ‚úÖ
    * A price coin marquee widget was added to the header of the page generated from [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/)

<br>

* As a user I want to.

    * Register ‚úÖ 
    * Comment ‚úÖ 
    * Like posts ‚úÖ
    * Be able to login ‚úÖ
    * Log out ‚úÖ
    * See how many likes on other content ‚úÖ
    * View all content as a user ‚úÖ
    * once users are signed up and logged in they cann add comments.
    * Users can not at this moment, edit their own comments, only admin can. As I would not like any negative words.

<br>

* Admin users can.

    * Add/edit/delete posts ‚úÖ
    * Create groups/users ‚úÖ
    * add attachments ‚úÖ
    * Social accounts ‚úÖ
    * Approve/delete selected comments ‚úÖ

* [Site User's I can view a paginated list of posts so that I may easily select a post to view.](https://github.com/Flow-matic/blockchain-blog/blob/main/media/user%20story%20pagination.png?raw=true)

  * Pagination is the method of separating digital content into different pages on a website. Users can navigate between these pages by clicking links, often in the form of numbers located at the bottom of a page. Paginated content is typically related by some common theme or purpose.

<br>

* [As a user I would like to delete my comments from posts.](https://github.com/Flow-matic/blockchain-blog/blob/main/media/user%20story%20delete.png?raw=true)

  * engaging with your audience via comments is an excellent way of making a connection with your target market. If you are able to provide customer service to comments from unsatisfied customers quickly, you can avoid losing such customers and end up gaining new ones as well.

<br>

* [Site admin can create, read, update, and delete posts so that I can mange the conntent. ](https://github.com/Flow-matic/blockchain-blog/blob/main/media/user%20story%20manage%20posts.png?raw=true)

  * Having a content management system for your website allows you to have control of your content. It means having the ability to update, change or delete any images, text, video, or audio. It allows you to keep your site organised, up to date and looking great. So many websites never review their content after launch.

<br>

* [User's can like and unlike comments, so they can interact with the content provided.](https://github.com/Flow-matic/blockchain-blog/blob/main/media/user%20story%20like:unlike.png?raw=true)

  * Every successful social media website offers features for users to engage with what they see: likes, loves, comments, and reactions.

<br>

* [Site user's can comment on posts so they maybe able to interact with conversations.](https://github.com/Flow-matic/blockchain-blog/blob/main/media/user%20story%20comment%20on%20a%20post.png?raw=true)

  * Algorithms on social media seem to favor comments and back-and-forth conversation. If your post gets a lot of comments, it will get more distribution.

<br>

* [User's will have to register an account, and be aproved by admin, before they can leave comments or edit, and add likes.](https://github.com/Flow-matic/blockchain-blog/blob/main/media/user%20story%20account%20registration.png?raw=true)

  *  Through the registration process, you can detect fraud and add a level of increased security to your website.

<br>

* [Visitors and site user's can click on post's to view and read the content available.](https://github.com/Flow-matic/blockchain-blog/blob/main/media/user%20story%20open%20a%20post.png?raw=true)

  * People may be more likely to pause on, interact with and respond positively to posts with creative that captures their attention. Every post should include creative, such as images

<br>

* [Site admin and users can view the number of likes for each post to see the most popular ones.](https://github.com/Flow-matic/blockchain-blog/blob/main/media/user%20story%20view%20likes.png?raw=true)

  * Popular posts can help you get more likes, comments, and shares, which can lead to organic reach and new followers.

<br>

* [As a site admin and user I can view comments on each post available.](https://github.com/Flow-matic/blockchain-blog/blob/main/media/user%20story%20view%20comments.png?raw=true)

  * Comments build the relationship among the readers/ users and the owners/writers.

## Deployment 

<br>

This project was created on Github then using Gitpod as a development environment to write and push code to Github, before being deployed to Heroku, with the media and static files stored on Cloudinary.

<br>

### Setting up the [![GitHub](https://badgen.net/badge/icon/github?icon=github&label)](https://github.com)

<br>

  * To put your project up on GitHub, you will need to create a [repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) for it to live in.

    * In the upper-right corner of any page, use the  drop-down menu, and select New repository.

    * Type a short, memorable name for your repository. For example, "hello-world".

    * Optionally, add a description of your repository. For example, "My first repository on GitHub."

    * Choose a repository visibility. For more information, [see](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories#about-repository-visibility)

    * Select Initialize this repository with a README.

    * Click Create repository.

Congratulations! You've successfully created your first repository, and initialized it with a README file.

<br>

### Using ![gitpod](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-ready--to--code-908a85?logo=gitpod)
  
  * Start your first workspace

    * The first time you login to Gitpod with GitHub, you will be prompted to ‚ÄúAuthorize Gitpod‚Äù to access your GitHub account. This creates a connection between Gitpod and your GitHub account, and installs an OAuth App in your GitHub [settings.](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/authentication/github)

    * Gitpod uses the name and email from your GitHub account ID to create a new Gitpod user account. This is sufficient to start a Gitpod workspace on a public repository.

    * Create a repository in [github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) with the desired name of your App or project.

    * Once your github repository is created, click the [green Gitpod button.](https://github.com/Flow-matic/blockchain-blog/blob/main/media/gitpod%20workspace%20green%20button.png?raw=true) This will automatically start creating your workspace environment.

    * [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) environment is used to write your code for your App then gets pushed to Github.

<br>

  * ![Python](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Python&message=3.6.7&color=blue&logo=python&logoColor=ffffff)
    
    * The packages installed for this project can be found in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Flow-matic/blockchain-blog/blob/main/requirements.txt)

<br> 

  * ![Django](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Django&message=2.2.16&color=092E20&logo=django)

    * Django was used as the python framework in the project.


<br>

### Setting up ![Heroku](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Heroku&message=PaaS&color=430098&logo=heroku)

<br>

Make sure you add a procfile to your root directory!

   * The Procfile is always a simple text file that is named [Procfile](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile) without a file extension. For example, Procfile.txt is not valid. The Procfile must live in your app‚Äôs root directory. It does not function if placed anywhere else.

   * Once you have your [account](https://www.heroku.com/) ready, login with your credentials.

   * Click New on the top right corner and select ‚ÄúCreate new app‚Äù.

   * Give your app a name (This will be included in the public URL for your application) and click Create app.

   * This step will take you to the dashboard of your app. Open Deploy tab and scroll to the ‚ÄúDeployment method‚Äù section.

   * Select GitHub as the method.

   * It will show a ‚ÄúConnect to GitHub‚Äù option where we can provide our GitHub repository. If you are doing it for the first time, Heroku will ask permission to access your GitHub account.

   * Here, you can search for your GitHub repository and click connect:

   * If it‚Äôs able to find and connect to the GitHub repository, the Deployment section will show up where you can select if you want Automatic Deployment (as soon as the changes are pushed to GitHub, Heroku will pick them up and deploy) or Manual Deployment.

   * Click Enable Automatic Deploys (because it‚Äôs less overhead for demo apps :) ). You can also select the GitHub branch if you need to, deploy from the main branch.

<br>

## Cloudinary

<br> 

What is the purpose of [Cloudinary?](https://cloudinary.com/)

* Cloudinary is an end-to-end image- and video-management solution for websites and mobile apps, covering everything from image and video uploads, storage, manipulations, optimizations to delivery.

* Cloudinary Media DB is a service that allows you to store media files in the cloud.

* Cloudinary is used by 1 million web and mobile application developers at more than 8,000 companies including Cond√© Nast, Dropbox, Forbes, Outbrain, Taboola and Answers.com. Inc. Magazine has called Cloudinary the "gold standard" of image management on the web.

* create your account with cloudinary first and follow these steps for storing your [media and static files.](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/how_to_integrate_cloudinary)  

* [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) was used to generate the browser icon, then the image was saved and uploaded to cloudinary.

## Testing

Validators
  
  * [html file](https://github.com/Flow-matic/blockchain-blog/blob/main/media/html%20errors.png?raw=true) was checked with [W3C markup validation](https://validator.w3.org/) some errors were flagged due to?

<br>

  * Using CoinMarketCap API widget that is displayed at the top of each page for Cryptocurrency prices.
      * The error has Something to do with the widget and not the website it‚Äôs self.

<br>

  * Cloudinary img element that was added through the Admin side of each post, wanted an alt attribute added.
      * The following alt was added to correct this issue. ( alt="cryptocurrency" ) within the index.html file.

<br>

  * Mailchimp subscription form has an error of using the same ( mc_embed_signup ) Duplicate ID within the form.
      * I need this for the subscription form to work.

<br>

  * [CSS file](https://github.com/Flow-matic/blockchain-blog/blob/main/media/css%20pass.png?raw=true) was checked using [CSS validation service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) all code was passed with [2 errors](https://github.com/Flow-matic/blockchain-blog/blob/main/media/css%20error%20.png?raw=true) coming from the (-webkit-transform) and (moz-transform) because it is a vendor extention.
  [This article explains the reason for the errors](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52490004/what-are-all-of-these-w3c-css-validation-warnings-about)

    * At this point, these look like they'd all be safe to remove from the CSS file, but there's no particular benefit in doing so.

<br>

  * [JS Hint](https://jshint.com/) was used for the small amount of JavaScript used, only [(use 'esversion 6')](https://github.com/Flow-matic/blockchain-blog/blob/main/media/js%20scipt%20error.png?raw=true) was flagged up, this article explained the reason for creating a [.jshintrc file in the directory](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27441803/why-does-jshint-throw-a-warning-if-i-am-using-const)

<br>

  * [PEP8](https://www.google.com/search?q=pep8+checker&rlz=1C5CHFA_enNZ963NZ963&oq=pep&aqs=chrome.0.69i59l2j46i131i433i512j69i57j46i131i433i512j69i65j69i60l2.3007j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) was used for testing python code. 

    * In the terminal by typing ( python3 -m flake8 ) and hit return will bring up all issuse within each python code file, saves you looking through every file one by one, hover across one of the errors then press down command and click. this will open the file and area of code that needs attention.

    * I chose to ignore any warnings on migration files susch as, (./.vscode/arctictern.py) (./blog/migrations/0001_initial.py). since these are automatically generated files so may ignore style rules for efficiency reasons. Also as developers, usually don't need to touch them so they don't need to be perfectly readable.

    * imported but unused, also line too long E501 were some common issues, Code was shortened within the urls.py and env.py files to fix these errors. One issue was when I shortened the ["DATABASE_URL"] Postgres code within the env.py file, I lost the website and it wouldn‚Äôt load, so I left it the way it was for now.

    * In the settings file one issue is AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS line too long, after loosing my Website when trying to shorten the ["DATABASE_URL"] Postgres, I didn‚Äôt want to create more issues, I have spent too much time and sleepless nights getting to this stage.

  * All errors were corrected too the files mentioned to the best of my ability.

<br>

  * Various browsers and devices have been also tested throughout.
     * [Mobile-Friendly-test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly) 
        *  About this tool

## [Error pages created for users.](https://github.com/Flow-matic/blockchain-blog/tree/main/templates)

<br>

## [400 Bad request error](https://github.com/Flow-matic/blockchain-blog/blob/main/templates/400.html)
  * The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 400 Bad Request response status code indicates that the server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (for example, malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing). 

## [HTTP 403 error](https://github.com/Flow-matic/blockchain-blog/blob/main/templates/403.html)
  * HTTP 403 forbidden errors are caused by an access misconfiguration on the client-side, which means you can usually resolve the issue yourself. A common cause of these errors is the file or folder permission settings, which control who can read, write, and execute the file or folder.

## [404 Page not found error](https://github.com/Flow-matic/blockchain-blog/blob/main/templates/404.html)
  * This error shows when a user types a URL into the browser which does not exist within the app's domain.page not found or file not found error message is a hypertext transfer protocol standard response code, to indicate that the browser was able to communicate with a given server, but the server could not find what was requested.

## [500 Internal server error](https://github.com/Flow-matic/blockchain-blog/blob/main/templates/500.html)
  * The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 500 Internal Server Error server error response code indicates that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.

This error response is a generic "catch-all" response. Usually, this indicates the server cannot find a better 5xx error code to response. Sometimes, server administrators log error responses like the 500 status code with more details about the request to prevent the error from happening again in the future.
